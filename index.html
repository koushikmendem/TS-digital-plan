    <!-- Chosen Palette: Soothing Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a task-oriented interactive calendar. The primary navigation allows users to select a week (1-4). This choice dynamically updates the main content area to display that week's specific plan. This structure was chosen to transform a static table into an active, manageable weekly planner, allowing a user to focus on immediate tasks without being overwhelmed by the full month's data. Each week is broken into "Student Enrollment" and "Business Growth" campaigns, with interactive cards that expand to reveal details on click. This enhances usability by layering information and creating a clear, task-focused user flow. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info (Weekly Course Focus) -> Goal (Inform) -> Viz (Dynamic Doughnut Chart) -> Interaction (Updates on week selection) -> Justification (Provides a quick, scannable visual summary of marketing priorities for the week) -> Library (Chart.js). Report Info (Demo Class/Franchise Plan) -> Goal (Organize/Inform) -> Presentation (Expandable HTML/CSS Cards) -> Interaction (Click to reveal details) -> Justification (Prevents information overload by hiding granular details until requested, keeping the main dashboard clean) -> Method (Vanilla JS). -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
